        <h2><a href="larb.html">Larb - (Thai Fresh and Citrus Mince Meat Salad)</a></h2>
        <p>I was lucky enough to be heavily exposed to Thai culture growing up, essentially being partially raised by my Thai 'aunty' and her family. This dish is one that fills me with memories of sweating on hot summer days at a table in the small restaurant she owned not far from my home. It's a dish that is both refreshing and filling, and one that I hope you enjoy as much as I do.</p>
        <p>Nittaya and Jan, I love you and miss you both very much. I hope we can see one another soon.</p>
