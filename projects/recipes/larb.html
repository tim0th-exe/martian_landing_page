    <h1>Larb</h1>

    <p>I was lucky enough to be heavily exposed to Thai culture growing up essentially being partially raised by my Thai 'aunty'
        and her family. This dish is one that fills me of memories sweating on hot summer days at a table in the small
    restaurant she owned not far from my home. It's a dish that is both refreshing and filling, and one that I hope you enjoy as much as I do.

    <p> Nittaya and Jan I love you and miss you both very much, I hope we can see one another soon.</p>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat:
            <ul>
                <li>In a pan, add enough water and a splash of fish sauce.</li>
                <li>Cook the meat until done. Optionally, you can stir-fry the cooked meat briefly for a nice sear.</li>
                <li>Separate the cooked meat into a mixing bowl, leaving the fat in the pan.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Cook Mushrooms and Onions:
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the mushrooms in the remaining fat until all the water evaporates (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add a splash of soy sauce or oyster sauce for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>Add onions or shallots to the pan, just enough to wilt them (remove some of the raw taste).</li>
                <li>Transfer mushrooms and onions to the mixing bowl.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Prepare Lime Dressing:
            <ul>
                <li>Juice 4-5 limes into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix lime juice with 1 tablespoon of sugar, dried chili flakes, and 4 tablespoons of fish sauce (adjust to taste).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Add Aromatics:
            <ul>
                <li>Finely chop mint and coriander.</li>
                <li>Add mint, coriander, and toasted rice powder (if using) to the mixing bowl.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Combine and Adjust:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the lime dressing over the meat and vegetables in the mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix everything thoroughly to combine the flavors.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust the sweetness, saltiness, and acidity by adding more sugar, fish sauce, or lime juice as needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Serve the Larb with rice and crunchy lettuce leaves.</li>
                <li>Wrap rice and larb in a leaf and shove the whole thing in your mouth!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
