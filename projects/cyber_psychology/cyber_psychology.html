        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The current study aimed to investigate the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool for facilitating nature-based well-being interventions. The current study utilized a randomized controlled trial with three conditions: VR nature-based meditation intervention, non-nature-based VR meditation, and a control group with no VR intervention. The study aimed to examine the effects of the different interventions on participants' mental health by measuring changes in their levels of positive and negative affect, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression before and after the interventions.</p>

        <p>The results of the study partially supported the hypothesis that the VR nature-based meditation group would demonstrate greater improvement scores in emotional and psychological well-being compared to the VR non-nature-based meditation and control groups. Specifically, both VR meditation groups showed larger increases in positive affect scores compared to the standard intervention group, indicating greater improvements in emotional well-being. Additionally, the VR nature environment group and the standard intervention group showed larger decreases in negative affect scores compared to the VR non-nature environment group, indicating greater improvements in psychological well-being.</p>

        <p>However, the results related to depression did not fully support the hypothesis, and the hypothesis related to stress was also not fully supported. Although stress levels were significantly lower at post-test than at pre-test for all groups, the change in stress levels from pre to post was not significantly different across the three intervention groups.</p>

        <p>This study provides valuable insights into the potential of VR as a tool for facilitating nature-based well-being interventions, and the results could have important implications for the development of new accessible interventions for individuals experiencing negative affect and stress. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of how technology can be used to support mental health and well-being. Further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these findings.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Over the course of our lives, we experience hugely varying emotions; these can differ between clinical and non-clinical states. The problem I want to address is that we often do not have access to tools to support us when we experience negative non-clinical states of affect, and when they become overbearing or affect our day-to-day lives. Meditation and mindfulness have shown to be a great tool for dealing with stress, and exposure to nature among other environmental factors play a key role in helping stress management and wellbeing or affect (Berman et al., 2008; McMahan & Estes, 2015). This current study is focusing on understanding whether Virtual Reality (VR) can further the positive effects of these tools and facilitate accessibility to them digitally.</p>

    <!-- Affect Section -->
    <section id="affect-content">
        <h2>Affect</h2>
        <p>Affect is a broad term used to describe the subjective experience of feeling or emotion. Affect can refer to a wide range of emotional experiences, from basic emotions such as happiness and sadness to more complex experiences such as guilt and shame. In psychology, affect is an important concept that has been studied extensively in areas such as social psychology, clinical psychology, and neuroscience.</p>
        <p>One important aspect of affect is valence, which refers to whether an emotion is positive or negative. Positive affect includes emotions such as happiness, joy, and contentment, while negative affect includes emotions such as sadness, anger, and anxiety. Research has shown that individuals with higher levels of positive affect tend to have better physical health, increased social support, and greater life satisfaction (Fredrickson, 2001).</p>
        <p>Another important aspect of affect is arousal, which refers to the level of activation or energy associated with an emotional experience. High arousal emotions include excitement and fear, while low arousal emotions include calm and relaxation. Research has shown that individuals with higher levels of arousal tend to have better cognitive performance and greater motivation (Ashby et al., 1999).</p>
        <p>Affect plays a significant role in social psychology, where it has been studied in the context of attitudes and persuasion. Research has shown that individuals in a positive affective state tend to be more persuasive and have more favourable attitudes toward persuasive messages (Petty et al., 2004). Additionally, affective states can influence social behaviour, such as aggression and cooperation (Côté & Moskowitz, 1998).</p>
        <p>Affect also plays a vital role in clinical psychology, where it is often a target of intervention. Therapies such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions aim to help individuals regulate their affect and manage their emotional experiences more effectively.</p>
        <p>Research has shown that affect can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including culture and individual differences. For example, individuals from different cultures may have different emotional experiences and express emotions differently (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Additionally, individual differences in personality traits, such as neuroticism and extraversion, have been found to be associated with different affective experiences (Watson & Clark, 1997).</p>
        <p>The Circumplex Model of Affect suggests that affect can be represented in a two-dimensional space, with valence (positive or negative) on one axis and arousal (activation or deactivation) on the other axis (Russell, 1980).</p>
        <p>The nature of affect can be understood through different models in psychology. The Three-Dimensional Model of Affect suggests that affect can be represented in a three-dimensional space. According to this model, valence, arousal, and dominance (the feeling of being in control or powerless) are the three dimensions (Watson & Tellegen, 1985).</p>
        <p>Another model is the Component Process Model of Emotion. This model proposes that emotions are composed of several components, including appraisal, physiological arousal, and expressive behaviour (Scherer, 2005). These models offer distinct perspectives on affect and have been applied to guide research and clinical practice in psychology.</p>
        <p>Affect and stress are closely related concepts in the field of psychology. Affect refers to the subjective experience of emotion, while stress refers to a state of psychological and physiological arousal in response to a perceived threat or challenge. Affect is closely related to stress and combined have significant impacts on physical and mental health (Cohen et al., 2007; Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988).</p>

    <!-- Stress Section -->
    <section id="stress-content">
        <h2>Stress</h2>

        <p>Stress has been linked to a wide range of negative physical and mental health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anxiety, and depression (Cohen et al., 2007; McEwen, 2012). Stress can also impact cognitive functioning, with chronic stress being associated with deficits in attention, memory, and decision-making (McEwen, 2012).</p>

        <p>Stress is a widely studied concept in psychology and has been defined in a variety of ways. According to Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping, stress is a result of a person's appraisal of a situation as exceeding their resources and threatening their well-being, and the resulting emotional and physiological response to that situation (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). This model emphasizes the subjective nature of stress and the importance of coping strategies in managing it.</p>

        <p>Other models, such as the general adaptation syndrome proposed by (Selye, 1978), suggest that stress is a physiological response to any type of demand or stressor, regardless of its emotional significance.</p>

        <p>Several factors have been identified as contributing to the experience of stress, including individual differences in coping strategies, social support, and environmental stressors such as work demands and financial difficulties (Cohen et al., 2007). Stress management interventions, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based interventions, and relaxation techniques, have been found to be effective in reducing stress and improving physical and mental health outcomes (Chiesa & Serretti, 2009; Fjorback et al., 2011; Hofmann et al., 2010).</p>

        <p>Stress has been linked to negative impacts on physical and mental health, and reducing stress is important for maintaining overall wellbeing (Cohen et al., 2012; McEwen, 2006). Improving wellbeing involves taking proactive steps to enhance one's health, happiness, and satisfaction with life (Diener et al., 2010). Research has shown that strategies such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support can be effective in improving wellbeing (Cohen & Pressman, 2006; Keyes, 2007; Khoury et al., 2015).</p>

        <h2>Wellbeing</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Measurement of Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>Wellbeing is a complex construct that encompasses various aspects of an individual's life, including their physical, emotional, and social functioning. It has been defined in many ways, but one common definition is the subjective experience of happiness and life satisfaction, as well as the absence of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. Measures of wellbeing often include self-report questionnaires that assess various aspects of psychological functioning, such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). (Diener et al., 2002)</p>

        <h3>Factors That Influence Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>Wellbeing is a complex construct influenced by various internal and external factors. Personality traits, social support, physical health, engagement in activities, culture, and values are among the factors found to influence wellbeing. For instance, extraversion and emotional stability have been positively associated with wellbeing, while chronic stress and exposure to negative life events have been negatively linked with it. Engaging in pleasurable and meaningful activities has been found to promote wellbeing, while certain cultural factors such as collectivism are associated with higher levels of wellbeing. These factors highlight the interconnectedness of stress and affective states with wellbeing, where stress and negative affective states can negatively impact an individual's quality of life (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Costa & McCrae, 1980; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), 2021; Huta & Ryan, 2010; Kessler & McLeod, 1985; Keyes, 2002; Triandis, 2001). Therefore, understanding and managing stress and affective states are essential for promoting wellbeing.</p>

    <!-- Interventions to Improve Wellbeing Section -->
    <section id="wellbeing-interventions-content">
        <h3>Interventions to Improve Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>Numerous interventions have been developed to enhance individuals' wellbeing, with positive psychology interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, and physical activity interventions being some of the most widely studied.</p>

        <p>Positive psychology interventions, such as gratitude journaling and acts of kindness, aim to cultivate positive emotions, behaviours, and cognitions (Seligman et al., 2005).</p>

        <p>Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness meditation, aim to increase present-moment awareness and reduce negative emotions (Khoury et al., 2015).</p>

        <p>Physical activity interventions, such as exercise programs, have been found to be associated with higher levels of wellbeing (Penedo & Dahn, 2005). These interventions can be beneficial in promoting wellbeing and improving overall quality of life.</p>

        <p>Research has shown that various interventions, including positive psychology, mindfulness, and physical activity, can effectively improve an individual's wellbeing. While these interventions focus on personal practices, it is also important to consider the role of the physical environment in promoting wellbeing. Access to nature and green spaces has been found to have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing (Bratman et al., 2012). Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and prioritize the importance of the physical environment in promoting and maintaining wellbeing.</p>

    <!-- Environmental Effects Section -->
    <section id="environmental-effects-content">
        <h3>Environmental Effects</h3>
        <p>Nature has long been viewed as a source of solace and tranquillity for individuals seeking a respite from the stresses of daily life. Indeed, research has shown that exposure to natural environments can have a profound impact on mental wellbeing.</p>

        <p>One of the theoretical frameworks that seeks to explain this phenomenon is Attentional Restoration Theory (ART) (R. Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989). According to ART, exposure to natural environments allows individuals to replenish their mental resources by providing a respite from the constant demands of daily life, which require directed attention. Natural environments, on the other hand, provide opportunities for effortless attention, which can promote restoration and recovery from cognitive fatigue (S. Kaplan & Berman, 2010).</p>

        <p>The physical environment can have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with exposure to natural environments and green spaces being associated with reduced stress, improved mood, and better cognitive function (Beyer et al., 2014).</p>

        <p>Research has shown that exposure to nature can have positive effects on mental wellbeing. For example, a study by (Bratman et al., 2015), found that participants who went for a 90-minute walk in a natural setting reported lower levels of rumination, a risk factor for depression, than those who walked in an urban environment.</p>

        <p>Similarly, a study by (Berman et al., 2008) found that cognitive performance improved after participants viewed pictures of nature compared to urban scenes. Another study by (van den Berg et al., 2010) found that living in areas with green spaces was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. A review by (Shanahan et al., 2016) also found that exposure to natural environments, such as parks and forests, was associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>

        <p>These studies suggest that incorporating natural environments into daily life may have important implications for promoting mental wellbeing.</p>

        <p>Overall, research suggests that exposure to natural environments and other elements of the physical environment can have positive effects on mental wellbeing. These findings suggest that incorporating natural elements into our built environments or having access to them on demand can have significant benefits for mental health.</p>

        <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
        <p>Exposure to natural environments has been shown to have significant positive effects on mental wellbeing, including reduced stress, improved mood, and better cognitive function. However, one issue with this type of intervention is that access to natural environments is not always readily available, particularly for individuals who live in urban areas.</p>

        <p>This raises the question of whether simulations of natural environments, such as virtual reality (VR) environments, could generate similar wellbeing benefits as exposure to the real thing. By providing a simulated natural environment, VR technology may offer a novel approach to promoting mental wellbeing, particularly for those who lack access to real-world natural environments.</p>

        <p>Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that allows users to experience a digital environment as if they were physically present within it. VR users can be transported to natural environments such as forests, beaches, or mountains, without leaving their urban environment. This can be particularly beneficial for people who have limited access to green spaces, are unable to travel to natural settings, or have physical limitations that prevent them from engaging in outdoor activities.</p>

        <p>Virtual reality experiences can also be designed to incorporate evidence-based techniques for promoting wellbeing, such as mindfulness, meditation, and breathing exercises, to help users reduce stress, increase relaxation, and improve overall mental health. By leveraging the power of VR, people in cities can now experience the benefits of nature-based interventions and enhance their wellbeing, regardless of their physical location or personal circumstances.</p>

        <p>In recent years, VR has gained attention in the field of psychology as a tool for assessment, treatment, and research. VR has been used to simulate real-world scenarios and environments, including exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, social skills training for individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and rehabilitation for stroke patients (Parsons & Rizzo, 2008).</p>

        <p>Additionally, VR has been used in research studies to manipulate environmental factors such as spatial layout and perspective, providing a new way to study human cognition and behaviour (Slater & Wilbur, 1997).</p>

        <p>One of the most significant advantages of VR is its ability to create a sense of presence and immersion, which can increase engagement and emotional involvement (Schuemie et al., 2001). The immersive nature of VR also allows for a high degree of control over the environment and stimuli, making it possible to create controlled experimental conditions that are difficult or impossible to achieve in real life (Slater, 2009).</p>

        <p>VR has also been found to be an effective tool for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Freeman et al., 2017; Rothbaum et al., 2001).</p>

        <p>Research suggests that the novelty and sense of presence in VR can help to distract individuals from negative thoughts and feelings, and create a more positive emotional state (Slater & Sanchez-Vives, 2016). Another application of VR in promoting wellbeing is through meditation practices. VR can provide a unique environment for meditation, allowing individuals to be fully immersed in a calming and relaxing atmosphere. Studies have shown that VR meditation can lead to increased relaxation and stress reduction (Kim et al., 2021).</p>

        <p>Virtual reality (VR) is becoming an increasingly popular tool for promoting mental wellbeing. While exposure to natural environments has been linked to a range of positive mental health outcomes, including reduced stress and improved mood, not everyone has access to such environments, particularly those living in urban areas.</p>

        <p>This raises the question of whether simulations of natural environments might offer similar benefits to the real thing. One potential application of VR for mental wellbeing is in meditation, with studies showing its potential benefits for stress reduction and improved emotional regulation (Bouchard et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2019).</p>

        <p>However, it is important to consider the specific use of natural VR spaces. While there may not be extensive research on this topic yet, the concept of "place illusion" suggests that virtual natural environments can provide a sense of immersion and presence that can enhance their therapeutic potential (Sanchez-Vives & Slater, 2005). Thus, investigating the use of virtual natural environments may offer a promising avenue for promoting mental wellbeing through technology.</p>

    <section id="rationale-content">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>Overall, a study exploring the effectiveness of VR as a tool for facilitating nature-based wellbeing interventions could provide valuable insights into the potential of this technology to improve affect, reduce stress, and enhance overall wellbeing. The results of such a study could have important implications for the development of new accessible interventions for individuals experiencing negative affect and stress.</p>

        <!-- Design, Variables, and Hypothesis Section -->
        <h3>Design, Variables, and Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>The current study is comprised of a randomized controlled trial with 1 between participants factor: intervention type, 3 conditions: VR natural environment wellbeing intervention, VR non-natural environment wellbeing intervention, and a traditional non-VR wellbeing intervention</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent variable:</strong> The type of meditation intervention (VR nature-based meditation, non-nature-based VR meditation, or traditional meditation)</li>
            <li><strong>Dependent variables:</strong> The difference between the scores on the PANAS scale (measuring positive and negative affect), the Perceived Stress Scale (measuring perceived stress), and the HADS scale (measuring symptoms of non-clinical anxiety and depression) pre and post intervention</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We expect that the VR nature-based meditation group will show greater improvement scores on the PANAS, PSs, and HADs in emotional and psychological well-being compared to the VR non-nature-based meditation and control groups. We also expect that both VR meditation groups will show greater improvements in the PANAS, PSs, and HADs scores than the control group.</p>

        <!-- Method Section -->
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 22 adults (aged 18-65) participants were known to the researcher or recruited through snowballing.</p>

        <p><strong>Design:</strong> This study utilized an experimental design with three conditions: a VR nature-based meditation intervention, a non-nature-based VR meditation condition, and a control condition with no VR. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The study aimed to examine the effects of the different interventions on participants' mental health by measuring changes in their levels of positive and negative affect, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression before and after the interventions.</p>

        <p>The use of multiple conditions and randomized assignment helped to control for potential confounding factors and increase the internal validity of the study. The study was conducted in a laboratory setting to ensure consistent and controlled conditions across all participants.</p>

    <!-- Materials/Stimuli Section -->
    <section id="materials-stimuli-content">
        <h3>Materials/Stimuli</h3>
        <p>For the VR nature-based meditation intervention, participants used a Meta Quest 2 VR headset to immerse themselves in a forest environment and were instructed to focus on their breathing and the sounds of nature whilst being guided through a mindful meditation exercise (see appendix 2).</p>

        <p>The non-nature-based VR meditation condition involved a VR headset with a neutral environment comprised of white walls, and participants were instructed to focus on their breathing and taken through a guided mindfulness meditation.</p>

        <p>The control condition involved no VR and participants were instructed to close their eyes and focus on their breathing whilst also being guided through mindful meditation. All conditions lasted 10 minutes and utilised the same guided meditation recording and script from the ‘Guided Meditation VR’ app obtained through the Meta Quest store (<a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3385318684883998/" target="_blank">Guided Meditation VR App</a>). The recording was a general wellbeing guided meditation encouraging participants to focus on their breath and mindfulness.</p>

        <!-- Procedure Section -->
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>Before and after the intervention, participants completed three questionnaires to assess various aspects of their mental health: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988)the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; (Cohen et al., 1983), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983).</p>

        <p>The PANAS measured levels of positive and negative affect, with example items including "interested" for positive affect and "irritable" for negative affect. The PSS assessed participants' levels of perceived stress, with an example item being "In the last month, how often have you felt nervous and stressed?" The HADS measured levels of anxiety and depression, with example items including "I feel tense or 'wound up'" for anxiety and "I have lost interest in my appearance" for depression. The full questionnaires can be found in the references.</p>

        <p>Ethically, all participants provided informed consent prior to participating in the study and were debriefed afterwards. Data was stored securely on a university OneDrive account and anonymized by assigning a unique 4-digit number to each participant.</p>

    <!-- General Explanation -->
    <h3>General Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        In this next section, graphs and inferential statistics for each measure are presented.
        When referring to the significance of 'time,' it pertains to the difference in scores pre and post-intervention.
        A significant effect of time indicates that the interventions were statistically significant in their effects on the wellbeing measure.
        When discussing the interaction of 'time and intervention,' it signifies the statistical significance of each individual intervention's effects on the difference between pre and post scores.
    </p>

    <!-- Positive Affect Section -->
    <h3>Positive Affect</h3>
    <p>
        For positive affect, the analysis found significant main effects for time (F(1,19)=52.173, p<.001, partial eta squared=.733)
        and the interaction of time and intervention (F(2,38)=11.397, p<.001, partial eta squared=.545).
        Descriptive statistics showed that positive affect scores were higher at post-test than at pre-test for all groups,
        but the increase was larger for the Virtual Reality (Nature Environment) group and the Virtual Reality (Non-Nature Environment) group than for the Standard Intervention group.

        and the interaction of time and intervention (F(2,38)=3.903, p=.038, partial eta squared=.291).
        Descriptive statistics showed that negative affect scores were lower at post-test than at pre-test for all groups,
        but the decrease was larger for the Virtual Reality (Nature Environment) group and the Standard Intervention group than for the Virtual Reality (Non-Nature Environment) group.

    <h3>Depression</h3>
    <p>
        For depression, the results of the tests of within-subjects effects show that the main effect of time was significant (p = .039),
        indicating that there was a significant difference between the pre- and post-measurements of depression.
        The effect size (partial eta squared) was .206, indicating a moderate effect size.
        The interaction between time and intervention was not significant (p = .232),
        indicating that the effect of time did not differ significantly across the different levels of intervention.

        For anxiety, the results of the tests of within-subjects effects show that the main effect of time was significant (p = .002),
        indicating that there was a significant difference between the pre- and post-measurements of anxiety.
        The effect size (partial eta squared) was .399, indicating a large effect size.
        The interaction between time and intervention was significant (p = .001),
        indicating that the effect of time differed significantly across the different levels of intervention.
        The effect size (partial eta squared) was .507, indicating a large effect size.

    <!-- Overall Summary -->
    <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The results suggest that all three interventions were equally effective in reducing stress levels from pre to post-test,
        with no significant differences observed among them.
    </p>

    <!-- Results and the Hypothesis -->
    <p>Based on the results of the current study, it can be said that the hypothesis:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>‘We expect that the VR nature-based meditation group will show greater improvement scores on the PANAs, PSs, and HADs in emotional and psychological well-being compared to the VR non-nature-based meditation and control groups. We also expect that both VR meditation groups will show greater improvements in the PANAs, PSs, and HADs scores than the control group.’</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>was partially supported.</p>

    <!-- Positive Affect -->
    <p>The results indicate that both VR meditation groups showed larger increases in positive affect scores compared to the standard intervention group. This supports the hypothesis that the VR meditation groups would show greater improvement scores on the PANAs in emotional well-being compared to the control group.</p>

    <!-- Negative Affect -->
    <p>The results indicate that the VR nature environment group and the standard intervention group showed larger decreases in negative affect scores compared to the VR non-nature environment group. This supports the hypothesis that the VR nature-based meditation group would show greater improvement scores on the HADs in psychological well-being compared to the VR non-nature-based meditation group.</p>

    <!-- Depression -->
    <p>Regarding depression, the results indicate that there was a significant main effect of time, but no significant interaction effect between time and intervention. This means that there was a significant difference between pre- and post-measurements of depression, but this difference was not significantly different across the distinct types of intervention. Thus, the hypothesis related to depression was not fully supported.</p>

    <!-- Anxiety -->
    <p>Regarding anxiety, the results indicate that there was a significant main effect of time and a significant interaction effect between time and intervention. This means that there was a significant difference between pre- and post-measurements of anxiety, and this difference differed significantly across the different types of intervention. Thus, the hypothesis related to anxiety was partially supported.</p>

    <!-- Stress -->
    <p>Regarding stress, the results indicate that there was a significant main effect of time, but no significant interaction effect between time and intervention or main effect of intervention. This means that stress levels were significantly lower at post-test than at pre-test for all groups, but the change in stress levels from pre to post was not significantly different across the three intervention groups. Thus, the hypothesis related to stress was not fully supported.</p>

    <!-- Discussion -->
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>The results of this study partially support the hypothesis that the VR nature-based meditation group would demonstrate greater improvement scores on the PANAs, PSs, and HADs in emotional and psychological well-being compared to the VR non-nature-based meditation and control groups. Specifically, both VR meditation groups showed larger increases in positive affect scores compared to the standard intervention group, indicating greater improvements in emotional well-being. Additionally, the VR nature environment group and the standard intervention group showed larger decreases in negative affect scores compared to the VR non-nature environment group, indicating greater improvements in psychological well-being.</p>

    <p>However, the results related to depression did not fully support the hypothesis, as there was no significant interaction effect between time and intervention. This means that while there was a significant difference between pre- and post-measurements of depression, this difference was not significantly different across the different levels of intervention. The hypothesis related to stress was also not fully supported, as there was no significant interaction effect between time and intervention or main effect of intervention. Although stress levels were significantly lower at post-test than at pre-test for all groups, the change in stress levels from pre to post was not significantly different across the three intervention groups.</p>

    <p>These findings are consistent with previous research on the use of VR and nature-based interventions to improve emotional and psychological well-being (Bratman et al., 2015; Garrett et al., 2018). However, some studies have found mixed results when examining the effects of VR and nature-based interventions on specific measures of emotional and psychological well-being, such as depression and anxiety (Riva et al., 2016). Thus, while the results of the current study provide support for the use of VR and nature-based interventions to improve emotional and psychological well-being, further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of these interventions for different populations and measures of well-being.</p>

    <p>While the current study provides evidence for the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) nature-based meditation and standard intervention in improving emotional and psychological well-being, the results are not consistent with some previous studies.</p>

    <p>While the current study provides support for the effectiveness of virtual reality-based meditation interventions for improving emotional and psychological well-being, there are some results that are not consistent with previous research. Specifically, the current study found no significant main effect of intervention on depression, while some previous studies have reported significant improvements in depression symptoms following virtual reality-based meditation interventions.</p>

    <p>For example, a study by (Navarro-Haro et al., 2017) found that a virtual reality-based mindfulness meditation intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression in a sample of breast cancer survivors. Similarly, a study by (Krijn et al., 2004) found that a virtual reality exposure therapy intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression in a sample of patients with fear of flying.</p>

    <!-- Further Explanations -->
    <p>However, it should be noted that the current study used a different type of virtual reality-based meditation intervention, and the sample population was different from those of the studies cited above. Therefore, it is possible that the differences in results are due to differences in the intervention type or population.</p>

    <p>Overall, while the current study provides support for the effectiveness of virtual reality-based meditation interventions for improving emotional and psychological well-being, the results are not entirely consistent with previous research. Further research is needed to determine the specific factors that contribute to the effectiveness of virtual reality-based meditation interventions, as well as the populations for which they are most effective.</p>

    <p>One possible explanation for the differences between the current study and previous research may be due to the specific nature of the interventions used. While previous studies have focused on more traditional forms of mindfulness meditation or relaxation techniques, the current study used virtual reality technology to create a nature-based meditation environment.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the characteristics of the study participants may have contributed to the differences in results. For example, previous studies have included a range of populations, such as healthy adults, older adults, and individuals with clinical conditions. In contrast, the current study did not control for the demographic of participant.</p>

    <p>Another factor that could contribute to the discrepancies in findings is the use of different outcome measures across studies. The current study utilized the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess emotional and psychological well-being. However, other studies may have used different measures or included additional outcomes, such as cognitive performance or biomarkers of stress.</p>

    <p>Finally, differences in the research design and methodology, such as sample size, intervention duration, and control groups, could also play a role in the variability of results. It is important to note that each study has its unique strengths and limitations, and the differences in findings should be interpreted with caution.</p>

    <p>In summary, several factors could explain the differences between the current study and previous research, including differences in intervention type, study population, outcome measures, and research methodology. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of meditation interventions on emotional and psychological well-being, as well as the potential moderators and mediators of these effects.</p>

    <p>Firstly, the study is significant because it provides evidence that virtual reality meditation in a nature-based environment can lead to greater improvements in emotional and psychological well-being compared to standard interventions. For example, participants in the virtual reality nature-based meditation group showed larger increases in positive affect scores compared to the standard intervention group. This is important because it suggests that incorporating virtual reality technology in meditation interventions can be a promising tool to enhance the effectiveness of such interventions.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the study contributes to the growing body of research on the importance of nature-based interventions for improving psychological well-being. For example, the results indicate that the virtual reality nature environment group and the standard intervention group showed larger decreases in negative affect scores compared to the virtual reality non-nature environment group. This is consistent with previous research that suggests exposure to nature can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. The use of virtual reality technology in this study extends this research by showing that even simulated exposure to nature can have positive effects on emotional and psychological well-being.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, the study's findings on depression and anxiety provide important insights into the effectiveness of virtual reality meditation interventions for specific mental health conditions. While there was a significant main effect of time on depression scores, there was no significant interaction effect between time and intervention. This suggests that the virtual reality meditation interventions did not have a greater impact on depression compared to the standard intervention. On the other hand, the results indicate that there was a significant main effect of time and a significant interaction effect between time and intervention on anxiety scores. This suggests that virtual reality meditation interventions may be particularly effective for reducing anxiety symptoms.</p>

    <p>Overall, the results of this study add to the growing body of research on the effectiveness of virtual reality interventions for improving mental health and well-being. The study's findings on the benefits of nature-based interventions and the effectiveness of virtual reality interventions for anxiety provide important insights for future research and clinical practice in the field of mental health.</p>

    <p>The study's findings have significant implications for incorporating nature-based interventions in real-life settings, particularly in designing spaces for health and well-being. Architects and urban planners can incorporate natural elements such as greenery, water features, and natural light into buildings, offices, and public spaces to improve psychological well-being and reduce stress levels.</p>

    <!-- Nature-Based Interventions and VR Technology -->
    <p>For example, the Bosco Verticale in Milan, Italy, is a pair of residential towers covered in vegetation, creating a "vertical forest" that provides residents with access to nature even in an urban environment. Biophilic design can also be used in hospitals to reduce stress levels and improve patient outcomes.</p>

    <p>In addition, the accessibility of nature-based interventions is crucial for individuals who may have limited access to natural environments. Virtual reality (VR) technology can be used to provide immersive nature experiences to individuals who cannot access natural environments. For instance, hospitals and nursing homes can incorporate VR nature environments into their care settings to provide patients with a calming and restorative experience.</p>

    <p>The Virtual Forest is an example of using VR technology for nature-based interventions. It provides a virtual reality experience of a forest for individuals who cannot physically access a natural environment. The Virtual Forest uses real-time weather and lighting conditions to create an immersive experience that feels like a real forest.</p>

    <p>Overall, incorporating nature-based interventions into real-life settings and improving accessibility to nature-based interventions can promote psychological well-being, reduce stress levels, and improve overall health outcomes. This has implications for the design of spaces that promote well-being, the accessibility of nature-based interventions through virtual reality, and the incorporation of nature-based interventions in healthcare settings. By doing so, individuals can experience the benefits of nature and promote their overall well-being.</p>

    <!-- Limitations of the Study -->
    <h2>Limitations of the Study</h2>

    <p>The current study on the effectiveness of VR interventions for mental health treatment has some limitations that need to be addressed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential of VR interventions.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings to a larger population (Davidson & McEwen, 2012).</li>
        <li>Secondly, the study only examined short-term effects, and it is unclear whether these effects would persist over a longer period.</li>
        <li>Moreover, individual differences in response to different interventions were not accounted for in the study design (Hofmann et al., 2012).</li>
        <li>Lastly, the study did not control for prior experience with meditation, which may have influenced participants' responses to the interventions (Van Den Berg et al., 2015).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To address these limitations, future research needs to be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size to increase external validity. Future studies should also incorporate measures of engagement and exposure to better understand the relationship between these factors and the effectiveness of VR interventions for mental health treatment. Additionally, a longer follow-up period should be included to assess the sustainability of the intervention's effects. Furthermore, future research could investigate the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of VR interventions to identify the key components necessary for success.</p>

    <p>It is essential to address these limitations because VR interventions have the potential to provide a unique and effective approach to treating mental health disorders. A larger sample size would increase the statistical power of the study, and a longer follow-up period would provide information on the sustainability of the intervention's effects. Moreover, identifying individual differences in response to different interventions and investigating the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of VR interventions would inform the development of more effective interventions.</p>

    <p>While the current study provides valuable insights into the potential of VR interventions for mental health treatment, it is not without limitations. Addressing these limitations in future research would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential of VR interventions and inform the development of more effective interventions.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>In conclusion, the study suggests that VR nature-based meditation interventions have the potential to improve emotional and psychological well-being compared to non-nature-based VR meditation and traditional meditation interventions. The results provide valuable insights into the potential of VR technology as a tool for facilitating nature-based wellbeing interventions, which could be used to improve accessibility and availability of such interventions for individuals experiencing negative affect and stress. This could have significant real-life impact, as it may help to provide effective and accessible support for individuals dealing with stress and other non-clinical mental health concerns, especially in the case of those unable to access the beneficial effects of nature. Future research in this area could further explore the potential of VR technology for mental health interventions and help to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which nature-based interventions can improve emotional and psychological well-being.</p>
